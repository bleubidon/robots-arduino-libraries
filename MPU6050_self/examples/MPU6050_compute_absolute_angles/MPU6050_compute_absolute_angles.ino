// Note: for the measured absolute angles values to be alright, MPU6050::compute_absolute_angles needs to be run repeatedly with a relatively high frequency.
    // Consequently, a high serial baud rate is crucial.
    // This is due to the filter formula that is used to compute the absolute angles.
    // This applies both when using the gyroscope to compute those absolute angles and when ignoring it.

// Note: known flaw: it takes some significant time for the absolute angles values to settle to their final, stable value when transitioning quickly (i.e. slow response)

// Note: known flaw: when the orientation of the IMU is changed abruptly, the measured absolute angles have an oscillation phenomenon,
    // that may start with a peak in the same direction and opposite way relatively to the direction and way of the actual movement that occurred (overshoot).
    // This is probably due to the internal working of the accelerometer sensor
